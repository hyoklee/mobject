/* KEY TERMS
 * 
 * Pool:
 *      - an object container providing separate namespaces for objects
 *      - pools can have different placement & replication strategies
 *
 * Placement group (PG):
 *      - Groups of objects within a pool that share the same OSDs.
 *
 * CRUSH:
 *      - Data placement algorithm for RADOS objects, mapping OIDs to PGs.
 */

/* ASSUMPTIONS/QUESTIONS
 * - Initially we enforce one global pool for each mobject store instance for simplicity.
 *
 * - Does ch-placement offer an algorithm similar to crush (e.g., PG concept)? 
 *
 * - We will not implement any replication.
 *
 * - RADOS seems to expose object versions, but I only see them in the 'object operation' portion of their API, which is big and awkward (i.e., would love to not implement that). 
 *
 * - Do we need any of the following from RADOS:
 *      - async I/O operations?
 *      - cursor stuff?
 *      - snapshots?
 *      - extended attributes?
 * 
 * - RADOS API includes a watch/notify API that sounds like something we could build on top of a generic SSG pub-sub service, if we wanted.
